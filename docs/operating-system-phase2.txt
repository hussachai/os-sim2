
At first, I would design the system to allow Loader to correct the
number of data lines in case the data being provided are more than
the number specified in the load module format. But, the problem was
that Loader need to postpone memory allocation to the end of Load module
because it will not know the number of data until it already read all data.
This requires system to have buffer at least 128 words (equal to the largest 
partition of memory).  But, it doesn't make sense to have that much buffer
just to be able to fix one problem of incorrect number of data.
 After carefully thought, I decided to treat "EXTRA DATA UNUSED" incident as error. 
Then, I can design the buffer to be 8 words which reflect to the real system.
